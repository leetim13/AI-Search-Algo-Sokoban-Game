Tip1: Avoid moving a box to any given corners (creating a "dead end"). 
In other words, if we moved a box to a corner, there is no other way for us to
re-use or re-move this box in further iterations (resulting in a fail).

Tip2: Try to utilize the entire map area as much as possible. This helps us to
spread out boxes, especially those boxes which we don't need to currently 
move at the moment. Spreading out the boxes also means we have more choices of
moving different boxes at any given state.

Tip3: Avoid clustering of the robots. Since robots can not pass through robots
themselves, clustering of the robots together in the same small area makes it
more difficult to move the boxes (since robots might block each other's way).
