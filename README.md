# AI-Search-Algo-Sokoban-Game
An AI search algorithm to solve the Sokoban Puzzle involving multiple agents (robots), 
where warehouse robot(s) must push boxes into storage spaces on path containing obstacles and/or other boxes.

Implemented with various search strategies: ‘depth first’, ‘breadth first’, ‘best first’, (weighted) ‘a star’, or ‘custom’, and multiple heuristics 
to optimize search time and space complexity (denoted 'time bound' and 'cost bound').

Implemented cycle checking level: ‘none’, ‘path’, or ‘full’.
